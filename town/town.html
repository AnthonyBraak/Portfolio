        <h5>The namesake of the district: The Panke river</h5>
        <p>
          This river flows through the Berlin District. It's mostly shallow and
          children like to play in it on hot summer days.

        <h5>Many parks, a lot of green</h5>
        <p>
          Next to the rier, there are a lot of parks in Pankow that can be
          visited to have a nice stoll in. These include "Schönholzer Heide,"
          "Bürgerpark Pankow," "Schlosspark," and many more.

        <h5>The cinema "Blauer Stern"</h5>
        <p>
          I've watched quite a lot of movies here back when I was younger. It
          was one of the few cinemas where you could sit whereever you wanted.
          Or whereever you found a free seat.
